## Prologue

After the disappointment of *Seaborn*, I had to calm down and turn to matplotlib. I spent two days in reading the user's guide and FAQ of matplotlib and became fond of it.


## About documentation

First of all, the documentation of matplotlib is impressive. It is well-organized and in detail. If any fresh user would like to read the documentation (an over 2000 page document), I strongly recommend to begin with the FAQ part where basic concepts are explained.

The documentation of *Seaborn* is easy to read and based on use case. By contrast, the documentation of matplotlib is based on module, as a result, I did not know how to make a scatter plot or bar chart even after finished the "Beginner' Guide" and "Advanced Guide". It is understandable since matplotlib is such a comprehensive plotting system instead of a dedicated library. Moreover, everything is well explained in API.


## About API

I thought matplotlib is a small plotting system with which a data practitioner can plot. However, it is a BIG plotting system and not dedicated to data analysis or statistics. No one would think Matlab is easy to grasp, neither should matplotlib.

I think *Seaborn* and *ggplot* (by yhat) built on matplotlib are nice try to provide a dedicated solution for data practitioners, and I wish more similar libraries would emerge. 


## Conclusion

I was daunted by matplotlib before I open the documentation. But it turned out that it is not more difficult than ggplot (although much bigger). Besides, I found it interesting to read the documentation. One last thing, matplotlib provides a "ggplot" style, I like it.
